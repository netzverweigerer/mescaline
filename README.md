Introduction
============

This is a *very* lightweight way to get those cool fancy powerline'ish prompts into your beloved ZSH setup. I came up with this as a quick dirty proof-of-concept hack because I thought all frameworks for ZSH that deliver such functionality are bloated, but easily found out that people asked me to publish my work, so here it is. Feel free to contribute, if you feel anything is missing I'm very happy to get your pull requests or suggestions. If you have wishes for feautures, please get in contact.

Current features
================

*full* git support! know what you're doing without having to check!
