mescaline for zsh
=====================================================

Aims at providing a user-friendly sane zsh default setup.
Features the "mescaline" python script, an extremely
lightweight method for using powerline-style prompts
with ZSH. OS X is supported, as well. I recently ported
this to python3 and right now only tested the git
compatibility, so there might be some bugs for other
version control systems, still.

Installation
============
There is a minimalistic install.sh script for now.
That should get you up and running. If not, email me at <armin@arminius.org>.
