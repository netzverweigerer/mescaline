Introduction
============

This is a *very* lightweight way to get those cool fancy powerline'ish prompts into your beloved ZSH setup. I came up with this as a quick dirty proof-of-concept hack because I thought all frameworks for ZSH that deliver such functionality are bloated, but easily found out that people asked me to publish my work, so here it is. Feel free to contribute, if you feel anything is missing I'm very happy to get your pull requests or suggestions. If you have wishes for feautures, please get in contact.

Current features
================

*full* git support! That means you will get the current branch name you're on within the prompt, including an indicator for un-tracked files and an indicator telling you there are commits that you didn't push or pull, yet.

What does it look like?
