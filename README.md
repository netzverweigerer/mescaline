mescaline - sane defaults for zsh, based on powerline
=====================================================

This is a *very* minimalistic zsh setup supporting powerline themes.


Installation
============

It should be enough to extract these files to some place and simply symlink
the zshrc file to ~/.zshrc.

The following example creates ~/.mescaline with all the files you see in this
directory, and finally a symbolic link ~/.zshrc in your home directory,
pointing to ~/.zsh:

$ mkdir ~/.mescaline; cp * ~/.mescaline; cd; ln -s .mescaline/zshrc .zshrc

That's it, you're done.
